This project shows how to create a somewhat substantial web application using Django on Google App Engine.

In addition, I hope it will serve as a practical tool for the Python developer community, and hopefully for other open source communities.  As I've learned over the last two years at Google, where I developed a similar tool named Mondrian, proper code review habits can really improve the quality of a code base, and  good tools for code review will improve developers' life.

Some code in this project was derived from Mondrian, but this is not the full Mondrian tool.
